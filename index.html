                    Week 4 of 12 COMPLETED!!!!<br>
                    The last two weeks have been nothing short of eventful!<br>
                    First, I had the chance to represent The University of The West Indies, Five Islands Campus at the Inter-Campus Guild Council hosted by University of the West Indies, St. Augustine Campus. I presented on a Sustainability & Innovation Hackathon between campuses ‚Äî and it was received really well. Fingers crossed it‚Äôs implemented before I graduate!<br>
                    On top of that, my colleague Deondr√© Mayers (Guild Gender Representative) hosted a massive inter-school debate competition with the moot: ‚ÄúTraditional gender roles in Caribbean culture hinder social and economic progress.‚Äù My faculty didn‚Äôt win this time‚Ä¶ BUT I was named Best Speaker in my round! Guess yapping really does pay off sometimes. üòÖ<br>
                    Now we‚Äôre entering midsemester territory ‚Äî wish me luck!<br>

                    Week 2 of 12 completed at The University of The West Indies, Five Islands Campus!<br>
                    I‚Äôm still finding my footing in all of my courses while balancing schoolwork and extracurriculars, but I know with time I‚Äôll get everything under control.<br>
                    Right now, I‚Äôm preparing with my team for the #ICPC Latin America Contest, as well as getting ready to compete in the Caribbean #STEM Olympiads again!<br>
                    On top of that, I‚Äôll be representing the #GuildOfStudents in Trinidad this week for the first leg of the Inter-Campus Guild Council (#ICGC) Meeting, while continuing to work to ensure we‚Äôre advocating for and providing for our students at #UWIFIC. <br>
                    Definitely a productive and action-packed semester! üí™
